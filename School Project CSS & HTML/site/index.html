            <h2>Motorcycles & their usage</h2>
            <p>
                Motorcycles have existed for quite some time now and they are used for a decent
                amount of activities all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is used for off-road, racing, traveling, parkour and many more. Every motorcycle is also different
                from eachother. Why, you ask?
            </p>
            <p>
                A 2-stroke dirtbike for example is not the same as a 1000cc 4-stroke sportsbike. Both have their up &
                downs and are comparable. A 2-stroke requires more maintenance compared to a 4-stroke, as the engine
                functions more faster & wears off easily.

            <h2>What is the best motorcycle to ride with?</h2>
            <p>
                It's a subjective manner that we are talking about here.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sports bike isn't the same thing compared to an offroad one,
                as they are both used for different reasons.
                It all depends on where, how and when you ride & what exactly is the purpose of riding it.
