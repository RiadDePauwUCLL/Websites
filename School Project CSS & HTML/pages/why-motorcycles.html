            <h2>Why should you ride, why even BUY one?</h2>
            <p>From a personal perspective, motorcycles are a way of expressing your freedom and it keeps you moving
                through
                life. It has helped me in so many ways throughout my life. Travelling with my sportsbike has gotten
                me
                to
                understand many things about myself, and yet, I still got to discover so much more out there.

                sexiest
                angle.)

                        That picture was taken in Dinant, well-known city that has nice roads in the South of Belgium.
                        During the summer, you will see motorcycles everywhere around that place.

                    <p>
                        It's full of twisty roads and turns, the adrenaline rush and the scenic beauty
                        that comes with it is just unbeatable. The feeling of leaning into the curves
                        and feeling the wind against myself is simply exhilarating.
                        If you're a motorcycle enthusiast, I highly recommend adding these roads
                        to your bucket list.

                        Motorcycles have been part of my life for the past 4 years and it has dramatically changed me
                        into
                        the person I am as of today. I'm more energetic, more goal-oriented, more plans,... All in all,
                        it's
                        beneficial & fun in the long run. I have grown with the motorcycles I have ridden with & from
                        all the memories & experiences I have stumbled upon.

                        My motorcycle is customized to the point where I could say it describes who I am as a person.
                        From the cyrillic writing to the golden snakes on the side fairings, the entire covering on my
                        bike has a
                        meaningful & beautiful history behind it.

                    Along the journey/path you will take with your motorcycle, you're going to learn a lot about
                    yourself but also about your own motorcycle. You will learn what patience & practice means.
                    Obviously, you will also fall but eventually you will climb back up.
                    Eventually, you're going to grow as a person. It takes time to improve & learn,
                    but by putting ourselves into this hobby & giving it our all into
                    making it a passion makes this such a beautiful experience.

                        From time to time I ride in motorcycle groups. However though, from my experience riding in a
                        group can be quite dangerous so be wary of who you ride with. Usually when I ride in a group
                        it's improvised & I rarely plan my trips as I prefer going with the flow, it's quite how I live
                        my life day by day.

                        Both pictures were taken on different spots in Belgium & are different groups.

                        My vacations to France have always been enjoyable, and I have been there several times.
                        As you can see, one of the photos was taken in Paris, with the Eiffel Tower in the background.
                        I've been to this lovely city quite a few times already.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second & third picture, I was riding around Lille which is in the North of France. It's a
                        very calm & pretty city as well, lots of good places to go to, restaurants to eat at, beautiful
                        countryside and so much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I definitely recommend to also travel in the South Of France, it's amazing how big & full of
                        variety France has to offer. The amount of discoveries & memories I have made along my trips are
                        indescribable. Last picture was taken in the South in a small town.
