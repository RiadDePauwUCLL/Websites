        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>Wezembeek-Oppem is located next to the municipality of Kraainem, a little further away from the
            main roads, and is made up of two ancient villages on the very edge of the Forêt de Soignes. Until the end
            of the 19th century, the area was renowned for the purity of its water! The springs were exploited until the
            19th century, when the most famous of them was marketed under the name Elvire. Today, however, there is no
            trace - or memory, for that matter - of this unique specialty in the Brussels area.

            On the other hand, Wezembeek and Oppem have each preserved their castle. Wezembeek's dates back to the
            medieval period, but has been refurbished to 18th-century tastes. Oppem's is also ancient, although it was
            originally a convent. In the town square, the statue of a strange knight called Strauff-Hein evokes a sort
            of local Don Quixote. His head is topped by a bucket on which sits an owl. He beats a drum and plays the
            organ with... his foot.

            Apart from its exceptionally quiet residential areas, Wezembeek-Oppem has retained some of its rural aspects
            - you can still find a few sunken lanes - while offering all the convenience of the nearby Brussels suburbs.

            Like Kraainem, Linkebeek, Drogenbos, Wemmel and Rhode-Saint-Genèse, this Flemish commune now has a large
            French-speaking majority.

        <h2>What's known about my hometown?</h2>
        <p id="knownabout">My hometown is known about multiple things. Here's a list with a few examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Orphanages in WW2: </strong>During the Nazi German occupation in the Second World War, Wezembeek
                was the home of an orphanage set up by the Association of Belgian Jews(AJB), a Judenrat-like
                authority forcibly organised by the German occupational force and collaborating with the Nazis. The
                orphanage was for Jewish children whose parents had been murdered in Nazi extermination camps. From
                August 1944, the AJB, under hard pressure of the Comité de Défense des Juifs, decided to hide the
                children until the end of the occupation. The children were dispersed to Catholic schools, orphanages
                and other locations. During the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and January 1945, the children
                survived bombardment by American and British forces while in the basements of homes, schools and
                orphanages which were occupied by Nazi troops resisting the Allied forces. Children who were at the
                orphanage and survived include Regina Feld Glinzman (born 1935 as Rosa Feld in Antwerp) and Estelle
                Alter (born 1936 as Stella Feld in Antwerp).
            </li>
            <li><strong>International German School of Brussels: </strong>A German international school that is based
                within Wezembeek-Oppem, founded in 1803 & has around 500-800 students with around 80-100 teachers.</li>
