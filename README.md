My personal projects featuring CSS, HTML &amp; Javascript are all featured within that repository.

Big time fan of SCSS, it makes me giggle & it's soooo satisfying.

Keep in mind not every project is posted on here. ;)

I experiment quite a lot here & there, as I love working on all kinds of fun stuff.
Feel free to check them out & experiment!
